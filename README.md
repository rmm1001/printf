printf
---
This project was part of the ALX SE program curriculum which took place from 13 May to 18 May 2022. Here we were required to work in teams of two to create the `_printf()` function similar to `printf()` in the `C` standard library.

Files
---
Below we list the files in this directory and what they do in the program. The files can be compiled using the command:
`gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89 *.h *.c` using the `-o`option

- [\_printf.c](https://github.com/KatlegoMachethe/printf)	does all the heavy lifting.
- [conv\_specifiers.c](https://github.com/KatlegoMachethe/printf)	handles characters, `c`, strings, `s`, and percentage `%`.
- [conv\_specifiers\_1.c](https://github.com/KatlegoMachethe/printf)	handles integers (`i` abd `d`)
- [main.h](https://github.com/KatlegoMachethe/printf)	contains all the function prototypes for this project.
- [writer\_functions](https://github.com/KatlegoMachethe/printf)	contains all the necessary writing functions which are the `_putchar` and `_puts` functions inspired by those in the standard library.
